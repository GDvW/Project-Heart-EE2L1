\chapter{Introduction}

Being a vital organ, the heart is of paramount importance in keeping a human being alive. Therefore, it is necessary to identify anomalies as fast and accurate as possible, to ensure quick and adequate treatment. A straightforward method to do this is using the sound waves that the heart produces. A doctor can do this manually using a stethoscope, but to achieve faster and objective data, a microphone array is superior. This project aims to use a microphone array consisting of 6 microphones to locate the heart valves of a patient and possibly give a diagnosis.
